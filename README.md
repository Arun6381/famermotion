# React + Vite
Farmer Motion
Farmer Motion is a lightweight Python library designed to analyze and visualize motion patterns of farming equipment in agricultural fields. With Farmer Motion, users can easily track the movements of tractors, harvesters, and other machinery, providing valuable insights into field operations and efficiency.

Features
Motion Tracking: Farmer Motion utilizes advanced computer vision techniques to track the movement of farming equipment in real-time or from recorded videos.
Data Visualization: Generate detailed visualizations, including trajectory plots, speed profiles, and heatmaps, to understand equipment motion patterns.
Efficiency Analysis: Assess the efficiency of field operations by analyzing motion data, helping farmers optimize routes and workflows.
Customization: Farmer Motion offers customization options for visualization styles and data analysis parameters to suit specific user requirements.
Easy Integration: Integrate Farmer Motion seamlessly into existing agricultural software systems or use it as a standalone tool for motion analysis.
Installation
     pip install farmer-motion

Quick Start
  import farmer_motion

# Load video or real-time feed
video_path = "path/to/video.mp4"
farmer_motion.load_video(video_path)

# Analyze motion and visualize results
farmer_motion.analyze_motion()
farmer_motion.visualize_trajectory()
